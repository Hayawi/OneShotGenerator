Chaotic - Independence. I am a free spirit-no one tells me what to do. 
Lawful - Fairness. I never target people who can't afford to lose a few coins. 
Good - Charity. I distribute the money I acquire to the people who really need it. 
Chaotic - Creativity. I never run the same con twice. 
Good - Friendship. Material goods come and go. Bonds of friendship last forever. 
Any - Aspiration. I'm determined to make something of myself.
