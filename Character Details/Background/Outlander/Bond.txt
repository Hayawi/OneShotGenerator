1. My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me.
2. An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me.
3. I will bring terrible wrath down on the evildoers who destroyed my homeland.
4. I am the last of my tribe, and it is up to me to ensure their names enter legend.
5. I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it.
6. It is my duty to provide children to sustain my tribe.
