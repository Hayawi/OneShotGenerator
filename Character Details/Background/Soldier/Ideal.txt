Good - Greater Good. Our lot is to lay down our lives in defense of others. 
Lawful - Responsibility. I do what I must and obey just authority. 
Chaotic - Independence. When people follow orders blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny. 
Evil - Might. In life as in war, the stronger force wins. 
Neutral - Live and Let Live. Ideals aren't worth killing over or going to war for. 
Any - Nation. My city, nation, or people are all that matter.
