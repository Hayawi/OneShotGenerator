1. I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely.
2. I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple's hierarchy.
3. My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god.
4. Iam inflexible in my thinking.
5. I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.
6. Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life.
