1. I always have a plan for what to do when things go
wrong.

2. I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never
raise my voice or let my emotions control me.

3. The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations
of everything valuable-or where such things would be
hidden.

4. I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.

5. I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the
fairest often have the most to hide.

6. I don't pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never
tell me the odds.

7. The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I
can't do it.

8. I blow up at the slightest insult.
